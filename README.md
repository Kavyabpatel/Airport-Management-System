# Airport Management System

The Airport Management System project is designed to manage airport operations such as flights, passengers, airlines, and ticket booking in an organized and efficient manner. Managing airport records manually can be difficult and time-consuming, so this project provides a simple way to store, view, search, and manage airport data in one place.

This project is beginner-friendly and useful for students who want to understand Core Java concepts and real-world system design.
